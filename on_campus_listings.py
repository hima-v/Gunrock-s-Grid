"""
on_campus_listings.py
---------------------
Adds hardcoded on-campus UC Davis housing listings to scraped_listings.csv.
These can't be scraped from Craigslist/Apartments.com because they're
university-operated or P3 (public-private partnership) housing.

Data sourced from official 2025-2026 UC Davis Student Housing fee schedules
and property websites. Each listing gets a unique listing_id with prefix
"oc_" (on-campus) to distinguish from "cl_" (craigslist) entries.

Run this BEFORE enrich.py so the on-campus rows get enriched alongside
the scraped data.

Usage:
    python on_campus_listings.py
