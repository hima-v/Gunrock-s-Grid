# enrich.py
# takes the raw scraped csv and adds computed columns:
#   - neighborhood (North/South/East/West/Downtown Davis)
#   - dist_to_mu (distance to memorial union in miles)
#   - price_per_bed (monthly rent / number of bedrooms)
#   - price_per_sqft (rent / square footage)
#   - distances to all points of interest
#
# run this after the scraper finishes. reads scraped_listings.csv
# and writes enriched_listings.csv with the new columns
